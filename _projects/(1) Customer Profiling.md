# Multi-modal Customer Profiling of Twitter Users

Analyzing data from micro blogs is an increasingly interesting option for enterprises to learn about customer sentiments, public opinion, or unsatisfied needs. A better understanding of the underlying customer profiles (considering e.g. gender or age) can substantially enhance the economic value of the customer intimacy provided by this type of analytics.

We combined analyses based upon different types of data: A user-written tweet, the profile picture or the name (or alias). By combining those independent analyses, we not only achieve superior prediction performance, we increase the transparency and explainability of a performed prediction.
