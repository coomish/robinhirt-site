# prenode

prenode is a spin-off from KIT which I co-founded in November 2018. We have the vision to enable a cross-organizational ML model exchange in business ecosystems.

## Federated data in business ecosystems is under-utilized

Many companies face similar analytical challenges and have an interest in utilizing their data collaboratively. To keep data confidential, in most cases it is not desirable or feasible to unify data sources, which makes it impossible to utilize synergies in terms of AI model training.


## Establish the secure exchange of AI models in ecosystems

We use a privacy-preserving transfer-learning on federated data sources to exchange ML models across company borders without exposing IP. By establishing an autonomous black-box transfer learning architecture, ML models can be securely exchanged.
