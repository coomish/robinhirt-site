description: The WirVsVirus hackathon and our solution >Offie<.
---

As COVID-19 spreads across the world, we need to find and create new ways of solving the problems that occur and cope with the side effects, e.g. of a week/months long-lasting isolation.
The German federal government therefore encouraged individuals to participate in the #WirVsVirus (#WeVsVirus) hackathon. Everyone with time, interest and an internet connection was welcome to submit an idea. The catch: it was a completely digital hackathon, where even members of a team are spread across the country. The number of registered participants was insane: 43.000 (!) individuals participated.

I was intrigued by the idea of collaborating with others to find and create some solutions in this crisis. At first, I was sceptical on how such a remote hackathon would work, especially when a team is newly formed (as ours was). In retrospective, I was surprised how well everyone worked together and contributed to the solution.

As in every hackathon, the team has to work on a specific problem that falls into a domain of interest. In our case, we decided to work on the issue of isolation for millions of workers faced with their new workplace: the homeoffice.

Our answer to that is *Offie*, an intelligent assistant for individuals who have to be in home office over a longer period of time. He helps to cope with mental and practical issues that occur in the transition from working on-site to working completely remote at home.

## Full-time Home Office Poses Challenges

Generally, many people enjoy working from home - myself included. But caused by the recent shutdown, many workers are now *forced* to completely working from home. This is even for those who are home office enthusiasts a handful. Additionally, the majority of workers do not own a dedicated desk at home or have the required infrastructure, such as a reliable and fast internet connection. Families with children have to somehow homeschool their kids or entertain them. 

The social aspects inside a companies team also is poses challenges, as colleagues tend to have fewer conversations and exchanges might decline. For some workers it might be challenging to identify and target new customers, as events and fairs are prohibited. As we had a limited amount of time, we worked on 4 specific challenges:

* Less contact and exchange with colleagues

* No experience with remote meetings and workshops

* No clear separation between work and private life

* More time by saving the way to work

In this hackathon, we structured these issues into two categories: mental and practical challenges.

## Offie - Your Proactive Assistant for the Homeoffice

We had a long discussion on how to cope with these issues and came to the conclusion, that the individual worker needs to somehow "learn" how to work in the home office. The shift from phyisically going to work every day to switching to a remote work space is huge and requires a change of behaviour. 

With our solution *Offie*, we want to provide a tool for guiding one's journey towards being a home office pro. 

Offie consists of two parts - a webapp and a slack integration (more messengers are planned for the future).

After the user has registered in the web app, he is guided through the above mentioned areas and can rate his satisfaction and importance. As soon as he has connected this onboarding he can link Offie with Slack with just a few clicks.

After this connection he will receive tasks once a day, based on his selected challenges and preferences. These tasks aim to help him to overcome his mental and practical challenges in the home office. The user can mark each task as completed. On this basis, the individual progress is recorded and the user can always view it in the webapp.

## Remote Team Buidling and Team Work
Before the meetup, most members of our team didn't know eachother or had worked with eachother. Paired with the fact, that this was a fully remote hackathon, it was a welcome surprise that our collaboration worked that well.

After the start of the hackathon, we had a great discussion and brainstorming session on what we wanted to work on and chose the home office issue rather quickly. Following a thorough conversation about each individual's experience, we coordinated our efforts and started to work.

## After the Hackathon

Due to the really high number of submissions and the nature of the cause, there was no structured endeavour to find one winner and/or a price. What we got out of it was great nonetheless: we had the chance to contribute one (minor) solution. Individually, it was a great experience to work with the team in a situation like that and exchange ideas, problems and develop creative ideas for coping with those.

There were also a lot of cool solutions that come really close to ours: [HomeMe](https://devpost.com/software/personalisierter-home-office-begleiter) solves the exact same issue and  [Remote Tips](http://remote-tips.springworks.in/) popped up at producthunt shortly after the hackathon. 

My personal winner of the hackathon is [Toiletpaper Clans](https://devpost.com/software/46_gamification_toiletpaperclans), a game around hording toilet paper (of course in order to create awareness...).
